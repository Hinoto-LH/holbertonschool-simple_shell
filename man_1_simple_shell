.TH SIMPLE SHELL 1
.SH NAME
simple shell \- JA custom command-line interpreter (shell) supporting environment and options
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
-Option(s)
.SH  DESCRIPTION
.I simple shell
is a UNIX 
.B command interpreter
. It reads commands from standard input, parses them into tokens, and executes them. It handles both external programs and internal shell commands. This version supports command line arguments (options) and manages the process environment.
.PP
The execution logic follows these priorities:
.IP 1.
Check if the command is a \fBBuilt-in\fR (internal).
.IP 2.
Check if the command is a direct path (starts with / or .).
.IP 3.
Search for the command in the \fBPATH\fR directories.
.SH FEATURES
.SS Command Line Arguments
The shell tokenizes the input string using a custom \fBtokenizer\fR, allowing commands to be executed with multiple options (e.g., \fIls -l /tmp\fR).
.SS Built-in Commands
The following command is executed internally:
.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment variables to the standard output.
.SH INVOCATION
.B simple_shell
works in two modes:
.TP
.B Interactive Mode
Run \fI./hsh\fR. A prompt \fI$ \fR is displayed, and the shell waits for user input.
.TP
.B Non-Interactive Mode
Commands can be piped: \fIecho "env" | ./hsh\fR. No prompt is shown in this mode.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PATH
A list of directories the shell searches for executable files.
.TP
.B environ
An array of strings representing the environment passed to executed programs.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
When a command is not found, the shell prints an error message to \fIstderr\fR.
